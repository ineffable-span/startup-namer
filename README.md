# startup_namer

A Flutter Project developed using the flutter codelab : 
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)



It's a simple flutter app that displays a list of random names which can be used by startups to name themselves. It's fairly easily but encompasses a good deal of flutter framework concepts.

Stick around and see as it is built across the commits.
